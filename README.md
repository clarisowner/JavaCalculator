JavaCalculator

My name is Maksim Shesternev, and I present my first project â€” a simple calculator written in Java. 
This calculator supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division)

// the calculator accepts input numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive) and works exclusively with integers
